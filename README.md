An open-source binary debugger for Windows, aimed at malware analysis and reverse engineering of executables you do not have the source code for. There are many features available and a comprehensive [plugin system](https://plugins.x64dbg.com) to add your own. You can find more information on the [blog](https://x64dbg.com/blog)!

## Installation & Usage

1. Download a snapshot from [GitHub](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/releases), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/x64dbg/files/snapshots) or [OSDN](https://osdn.net/projects/x64dbg) and extract it in a location your user has write access to.
2. _Optionally_ use `x96dbg.exe` to register a shell extension and add shortcuts to your desktop.
3. You can now run `x32\x32dbg.exe` if you want to debug a 32-bit executable or `x64\x64dbg.exe` to debug a 64-bit executable! If you are unsure you can always run `x96dbg.exe` and choose your architecture there.

You can also [compile](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/wiki/Compiling-the-whole-project) x64dbg yourself with a few easy steps!

Without the help of many people and other open-source projects, it would not have been possible to make x64dbg what it is today, thank you!
