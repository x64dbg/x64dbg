# Source

If available, the source view displays the source file corresponding to a specific instruction. The debugger won't automatically do this; instead, the user must right-click the desired instruction in the disassembly view and select "Open Source File."

To successfully load the source file, both the debug symbols (typically the PDB file) and the source file must be accessible. Additionally, the debug symbols need to be loaded before the source file.
