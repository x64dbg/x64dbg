Notes
=====

Notes view have two text fields to edit, one globally and one for the debuggee. Any text entered here will be saved, and will be restored in future debugging sessions, so the user can make notes conveniently. Global notes will be stored in "notes.txt" under the working directory. Debuggee notes will be stored in the debug database. You cannot edit per-debuggee notes while not debugging.
