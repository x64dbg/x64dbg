==========
The x64dbg can be automated and extended in various ways: by the use of x64dbg script, :doc:`../commands/script/scriptdll`, a script written in a language provided by a scripting plugin, or an x64dbg plugin.

This section contains documentation intended to help developers to write code related to this program.

**Notice:** It is easy to compile x64dbg. If you find it is more interesting in working directly on x64dbg source code to add your new features, don't forget to share it with us on Github, as required by GPLv3 licence of x64dbg, so that everyone can benefit from a better x64dbg. It will also ensure your code won't suddenly break due to incompatible changes made by x64dbg team who don't know your work.
